		description `This Quarg ringworld is almost half completed, but there are no signs of active construction, and your ship's sensors picked up no energy signals from any section of the ring except for this one. You also observed superficial weapon scars on some parts of the ring, damage that the Quarg have not bothered to repair - although clearly the attackers did not possess weapons powerful enough to do any serious harm to the ring.`
		spaceport `Despite their size, the Quarg are generally almost silent when they move, and there seem to be very few of them left inhabiting this ringworld. As you walk through some parts of the spaceport it is utterly silent and seemingly deserted, and you are jolted by surprise each time the illusion of solitude is broken by a Quarg emerging suddenly from a doorway and striding silently past you. Every once in a while, louder footsteps announce the presence of a group of Korath visiting the station.`
		spaceport `	Although the spaceport offers all the usual amenities, including a small merchant's exchange for trading goods, you feel slightly self-conscious about breaking the silence of the station to speak to anyone.`
