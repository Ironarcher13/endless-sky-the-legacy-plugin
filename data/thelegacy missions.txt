			`While enjoying some food in a rather posh spaceport restaurants, you notice a group of 4 secretive elder gentlemen at a nearby table. One of the men keeps looking at you and finally gets up and comes over to your table.`
			`	"Sorry for the interruption, sir. Aren't you <first> <last>, the starship captain who played a vital role in the archeological discoveries on Zug?"`
			choice
				`"Yes, that's me"`
			`"In that case, you may be just the person we are looking for."`
			`	He introduces himself: "I am Benoit, and over there are my friends Sherlock, Hercule and Stephan. We are looking for a trustworthy and reliable captain who will transport us on a rather delicate and dangerous mission."`
			`	He looks at you rather conspicously and whispers: "We will solve the mystery of 'Rhon the Traveller'!"`
			`	You have no idea who Rhon the Traveller is, but the fancy restaurant and the impression that Benoit and his friends leave indicate that this could be a rather lucrative opportunity.`
			choice
				`	"Okay, tell me more."`
					goto "tell me more"
				`	"Who is Rhon the Traveller?"`
				`	"Sorry, but I am not interested"`
					goto "not interested 1"
			`Benoit looks surprised, but then explains: "Rhon the Traveller was a famous philosopher, philantropist and teacher. And stinkingly rich, if I may say so."`
			label "tell me more"
			`	"When Rhon died almost a year ago, everybody was wondering what would happen to his significant inheritence."`
			`	He smiles and continues: "It turns out he left the vast part of it to 'whomever is worthy by solving the clues I have laid out'. How typical of him."`
			`	Looking at his friends he finishes: "Rhon was quite a genius, so solving his puzzles is going to be tough, but that is exactly the challenge that my friends and I enjoy."`
			choice
				`	"Sounds interesting. What would I have to do?"`
				`	"I'm sorry, but I am not really interested into chasing phantoms."`
					goto "not interested 1"
			`"Well, you would have to take us to the legacy disclosure, where all intersted parties receive the first clue. This will be in the Kugel system and we will pay you <payment> just to take us there."`
			`	With a smile he continues: "After that, it depends on where the clues will take us. I would not be surprised if this will become a chase through the entire known galaxy. And maybe even beyond..."`
			`	His expression becomes earnest.`
			`	"I fear, it will also draw attention from some rather unpleasant and violent subjects. Therefore, you and your ship must be up to the task."`
			choice
				`	"So far, so good. But what is in it for me?"`
				`	"Sorry, but this sounds rather dubious to me. You have to look for someone else."`
					goto "not interested 1"
			`"Well, we will pay you for all your costs, no matter the outcome. But what might really pique your interest - Rhon's ship is also part of the inheritance. Since none of my group has any use for such a device, the ship would be yours, in case we succeed. That and 5 percent of the rest of the inheritance."`
			choice
				`	"That surely sounds interesting. Count me in"`

			`	Since you had never heard of him before, you are suprised that she knows him. You tell her so.`
			`	"Of course I know him. Rhon Danperi, that's his real name. But the pirates call him 'Rhon the Rat'. He started off as a lowly pirate and quickly ascended through the ranks. Then, from one day to the next, he renounced his pirate ways and became an outcast."`
			choice
				`	"What happened then?"`
			`"Well, he was wanted in most known systems and now the pirates were also after him. So, he did the only thing he could - he disappeared. No one knows where to, though."`
			`	"Twenty years later, he resurfaced. Since he had never killed anyone during his raids, he was no longer wanted by the law. So, he travelled through the systems and tried to make amends for what he had done in the past by helping."`
			`	"He also spread his message of peace. He quickly became popular amongst the poor, but also administration listen to his advice. He was a very smart man."`
			choice
				`	"What about then Pirates, though?"`
			`"You are right. The Pirates never forget and there was still a large bounty on his head. Several gangs tried to cash in, but it did them no good. Rhon never attacked, but those who went up against him, he destroyed without mercy."`
			`	"His ship could not be touched by anything build in human space. Rumor says he had filled it with alien technology. In the end, they left him alone. Turned him into a scare for little children."`
			choice
				`	"Wow, where do you know this from?"`
			`"They scared me with his name when I was little. But I don't like being scared, so I started digging and found out the complete story."`
			`	"It was actually his story which expired us to run off for a better life back then when we met you on Smuggler's Den."`
			`	You are fascinated by Maria's story and resolve to do some research of your own into this Rhon.`
			choice
				`	Offer Maria and Joe to show them the clue you have received from Benoit`

				`	Change the subject.`
			`You express your admiration for Maria's story and then change the subject. You enjoy the rest of your evening together and then return to your ship.`
				decline
			label "show it"
			`Upon hearing your offer, there is no stopping Maria. Joe smiles knowingly. Maria heads over to their neighbours and makes sure they watch over the kids. Then you are off to the Spaceport.`
			`	In the ship, you hand Maria the paper with the lines and dots. She takes a look at it and then begins to smile.`
			`	"<first>, can we have front and backpage scanned and then projected on each other?"`
			`	You perform the scans and bring them up on a holo screen.`
			`	"Joe, do you still recall Rhon's coat of arms?"`
			`	Joe paints a pattern onto a different corner of the screen. Maria makes some small adjustments and then resizes and projects it on top of the pattern scan. Then she cuts out three triangular portions.`
			`	"It must be these, already in his pirate days Rhon was obsessed with the number 3."`
			choice
				`	"That's right. The first clues were actually handed out 333 days after his death."`
			`Maria nods absently. She turns and overlaps the triangles and then flips the pieces until suddently the previously chaotic patterns connect and form a set of symbols.`
			`	Maria seems disappointed though. "That's an old pirate trick to encode informations, unless you know the areas and angles even the smartest computers will have trouble decoding this. However, those symbols mean absolutely nothing to me."`
			`	Now it is your turn to be excited. "They do to me. This looks like Hai writing. You have just solved the first clue."`
			`	Maria and Joe look confused. "Who are the Hai?"`
			`	"They are an alien race which I have met during my travels. "`
			choice
				`	I cannot read those symbols myself and to have them deciphered, I need to travel to the other side of a wormhole."`
			`You store a copy of the symbols on a data crystal and erase all traces of your discovery. You return with Joe and Maria to their home and spend the rest of the evening wondering about what is to come.`
			`	When it's time to leave, they wish you good luck for your adventure. You promise to give them a share if your hunt is successful.`
			`	Back on your ship, you start educating yourself about Rhon, his live and his teachings, and find that he was indeed a fascinating person. You feel that you are drawn into this adventure more than you intended. You decide to embark on the first step of the journey tomorrow.`
			`	You may have overdone it with your studies, tough. In your sleep you dream of Rhon visiting you.`

			`When you arrive at Sayari's place, she is not alone - Rek is with her.`
			`	"<first>, how good to see you again. I was just at the council to report on my progress, when I met Sayari. She mentioned you were also here, so I insisted to join her."`
			`	You notice that Rek's english has again improved. Sayari has somehow arranged for some suitable food for each of you to be delivered. During the meal, you wonder if Rek's presence does further or hinder your course. In any case, it is a wonderful evening with good food and conversations.`
			`	In the end, you decide that Rek's language capabilities may actually be helpful.`
			choice
				`	Disclose your story to both of them.`
			`When it seems to be the appropriate time, you start telling your friends about Rhon's legacy and how you stumbled into this adventure by pure coincidence.`
			`	While Rek is excited by the idea of a treasure hunt and a new adventure, Sayari becomes very quiet. When you show the symbols to Sayari, her look becomes distant, her eyes moist and she blinks. When she speaks, it is with a soft voice.`
			`	"I knew Rhon. And he may have actually learned the symbols from me, although I did not realize this until now."`
			`	You both stare at her in disbelief.`
			`	"It was many years ago, I had just started my first job and was working in the reception area of Allhome Spaceport. There he was, one day. Obviously, he had taken the trip through the wormhole by accident. I believe, at the time he had just deserted the Pirates and was fleeing the headhunters."`
			`	"I helped him to settle in. Rhon had a genuine interest into the Hai and their philosophy of peace. He was a fascinating man. We became ...close."`
			`	She pauses for a moment and then continues. "Back then, I was studying to advance in the governmental services. He helped me with that, and that's where he must have picked up the ancient symbols. He was a quick learner."`
			choice
				`	"What happened next?"`
			`"He was a special man, and many humans noticed that. I assume that one of them must have told the Pirates, because one day a fleet of them apeared in Hai space. I was working at the time, so I knew as soon as they had exited the worm hole. Rhon had always warned me that something like that might happen."`
			`	"We were prepared, so we managed to flee deeper into Hai space before they could find him. Rhon had hoped that he could shake them that way, but they continued and starting causing all sorts of troubles. So Rhon decided to leave Hai space to restore peace."`
			`	"He offered me to take me with him, but back then I was not ready to leave my people, so I declined." The regret in her voice is tangible.`
			`	"After that, I never saw him again. But I never forgot him. The time with him inspired me to learn more about the humans and to become the envoy for the human government."`
			`	She returns into the present. "I am glad to hear that he lived a good life and achieved redemption amongst humans."`
			choice
				`	"So, will you translate the symbols?"`
			`Sayari makes the chittering sound you know equals the Hai version of laughter. "I already have. 'Enter the system with the Iron Sky and utter the name of my Hai savior and friend'. So, do you know what to do?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I believe I have an idea of where we need to go."`
					goto "smart_player"
				`	"Sorry, but I am clueless. Can you help?"`
			`"I am pretty sure that the Iron Sky refers to the metallic meteorites of the Imo Dep system. I assume we need to go there and then you need to broadcast my name."`
			label "smart_player"
			`	Sayari blinks at you: "If you do not mind, I would like to accompony you on this quest. Somehow, I am already involved, anyway."`
			`	Rek, who can barely contain her excitement, chimes in: "Yes, and I would also like to come along. It has been a long time since I had anything that exciting and refreshing."`
			`	Somehow, you feel that your chances of solving this mystery just have significantly improved. You are glad that your friends have joined your quest.`

			`While on the landing approach, you notice that this time the facilities are much smaller. You barely fit your ship into the landing zone.`
			`	The facilities as such consist of a resting area and an additional room separated by a close gate. When you approach the gate, each member of the party is scanned.`
			`	When a voice speaks, you are glad you brought the translator, because it is speaking Hai. "Welcome, [seekers, explorers]. I will admit you for the next [clue, hint] in a moment. But first let Sayari enter alone."`

			`Sayari steps towards the gate, which opens, let her pass and then closes after her.`
			`	After a while, the gate opens again and the voice invites you to step forward. You join Sayari in a plain room which contains not much more but a holographic projector.`
			`	Sayari seems happy and sad at the same time. "Rhon had left me a personal farewell message. I am so glad that you brought me here."`
			`	At this moment, the holographic projector activates and an elderly Rhon stands in front of you. He also speaks in Hai.`
			`	"Welcome again, and I [appreciate, value] that you have brought Sayari with you. I can also see that each of you is from a different [species, origin]. This will help you at a later [time, moment]. But to get there, you will have to [follow the path, take the journey] that I took."`
			`	Beside the hologram, symbols appear in 4 lines. You have no difficulty recognizing them, they are Remnant hand signals, but you do not understand all of them.`
			`	"You may want to [record, memorize] them."`
			`	You do as the voice recommended and take a capture of the 4 lines. Once you are done, they vanish. The hologram bids you farewell: "Enjoy and [learn, grow] while you follow in my [footsteps, legacy].`
			`	With that, you are alone.`
			`	Rek issues a serious of clicks which, as you have learned, indicates his amusement. "You have already solved the 2nd clue - admit it."`
			choice
				`	"Well, yes and now. I know what these symbols are - they are signs from the Remants, a group of humans who fled the Alpha Wars into isolation and who now communicate through sign language on not by spoken word."`
			`Rek is excited. "That is fascinating. Albeit..." He looks down at his lengthy, claw-like fingers. Sayari looks at her small paws. They both look at you. "I believe, you will have to do the 'talking'". You all break out into laughter.`
			`	You try to dampen the mood a bit. "We will require help in any case. My 'Remnant' is not good enough. I recognize some of the symbols, but not enough. Unfortunately, the Remnant are pretty much at the other end of the galaxy."`
			`	Rek is not deterred: "Well, then we better depart." Sayari chimes in: "It's good then that I had our provisions stocked up before departure."`
