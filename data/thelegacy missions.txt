			`While enjoying some food in a rather posh spaceport restaurants, you notice a group of 4 secretive elder gentlemen at a nearby table. One of the men keeps looking at you and finally gets up and comes over to your table.`
			`	"Sorry for the interruption, sir. Aren't you <first> <last>, the starship captain who played a vital role in the archeological discoveries on Zug?"`
			choice
				`"Yes, that's me"`
			`"In that case, you may be just the person we are looking for."`
			`	He introduces himself: "I am Benoit, and over there are my friends Sherlock, Hercule and Stephan. We are looking for a trustworthy and reliable captain who will transport us on a rather delicate and dangerous mission."`
			`	He looks at you rather conspicously and whispers: "We will solve the mystery of 'Rhon the Traveller'!"`
			`	You have no idea who Rhon the Traveller is, but the fancy restaurant and the impression that Benoit and his friends leave indicate that this could be a rather lucrative opportunity.`
			choice
				`	"Okay, tell me more."`
					goto "tell me more"
				`	"Who is Rhon the Traveller?"`
				`	"Sorry, but I am not interested"`
					goto "not interested 1"
			`Benoit looks surprised, but then explains: "Rhon the Traveller was a famous philosopher, philantropist and teacher. And stinkingly rich, if I may say so."`
			label "tell me more"
			`	"When Rhon died almost a year ago, everybody was wondering what would happen to his significant inheritence."`
			`	He smiles and continues: "It turns out he left the vast part of it to 'whomever is worthy by solving the clues I have laid out'. How typical of him."`
			`	Looking at his friends he finishes: "Rhon was quite a genius, so solving his puzzles is going to be tough, but that is exactly the challenge that my friends and I enjoy."`
			choice
				`	"Sounds interesting. What would I have to do?"`
				`	"I'm sorry, but I am not really interested into chasing phantoms."`
					goto "not interested 1"
			`"Well, you would have to take us to the legacy disclosure, where all intersted parties receive the first clue. This will be in the Kugel system and we will pay you <payment> just to take us there."`
			`	With a smile he continues: "After that, it depends on where the clues will take us. I would not be surprised if this will become a chase through the entire known galaxy. And maybe even beyond..."`
			`	His expression becomes earnest.`
			`	"I fear, it will also draw attention from some rather unpleasant and violent subjects. Therefore, you and your ship must be up to the task."`
			choice
				`	"So far, so good. But what is in it for me?"`
				`	"Sorry, but this sounds rather dubious to me. You have to look for someone else."`
					goto "not interested 1"
			`"Well, we will pay you for all your costs, no matter the outcome. But what might really pique your interest - Rhon's ship is also part of the inheritance. Since none of my group has any use for such a device, the ship would be yours, in case we succeed. That and 5 percent of the rest of the inheritance."`
			choice
				`	"That surely sounds interesting. Count me in"`
					goto "count me in"

			`	Since you had never heard of him before, you are suprised that she knows him. You tell her so.`
			`	"Of course I know him. Rhon Danperi, that's his real name. But the pirates call him 'Rhon the Rat'. He started off as a lowly pirate and quickly ascended through the ranks. Then, from one day to the next, he renounced his pirate ways and became an outcast."`

			`	"He also spread his message of peace. He quickly became popular amongst the poor, but also administration listen to his advice. He was a very smart man."`
			choice
				`	"What about the Pirates, though?"`
			`"You are right. The Pirates never forget and there was still a large bounty on his head. Several gangs tried to cash in, but it did them no good. Rhon never attacked, but those who went up against him, he destroyed without mercy."`
			`	"His ship could not be touched by anything built in human space. Rumor says he had filled it with alien technology. In the end, they left him alone. Turned him into a scare for little children."`
			choice
				`	"Wow, where do you know this from?"`

			`	"<first>, can we have front and backpage scanned and then projected on each other?"`
			`	You perform the scans and bring them up on a holo screen.`
			`	"Joe, do you still recall Rhon's coat of arms?"`
			`	Joe paints a pattern onto a different corner of the screen. Maria makes some small adjustments and then resizes and projects it on top of the pattern scan. Then she cuts out three triangular portions.`
			`	"It must be these, already in his pirate days Rhon was obsessed with the number 3."`
			choice
				`	"That's right. The first clues were actually handed out 333 days after his death."`
			`Maria nods absently. She turns and overlaps the triangles and then flips the pieces until suddently the previously chaotic patterns connect and form a set of symbols.`
			`	Maria seems disappointed though. "That's an old pirate trick to encode informations, unless you know the areas and angles even the smartest computers will have trouble decoding this. However, those symbols mean absolutely nothing to me."`
			`	Now it is your turn to be excited. "They do to me. This looks like Hai writing. You have just solved the first clue."`
			`	Maria and Joe look confused. "Who are the Hai?"`
			`	"They are an alien race which I have met during my travels."`
			choice
				`	"I cannot read those symbols myself and to have them deciphered, I need to travel to the other side of a wormhole."`

			`When you arrive at Sayari's place, she is not alone - Rek is with her.`
			`	"<first>, how good to see you again. I was just at the council to report on my progress, when I met Sayari. She mentioned you were also here, so I insisted to join her."`
			`	You notice that Rek's english has again improved. Sayari has somehow arranged for some suitable food for each of you to be delivered. During the meal, you wonder if Rek's presence does further or hinder your cause. In any case, it is a wonderful evening with good food and conversations.`
			`	In the end, you decide that Rek's language capabilities may actually be helpful.`
			choice
				`	Disclose your story to both of them.`
			`When it seems to be the appropriate time, you start telling your friends about Rhon's legacy and how you stumbled into this adventure by pure coincidence.`
			`	While Rek is excited by the idea of a treasure hunt and a new adventure, Sayari becomes very quiet. When you show the symbols to Sayari, her look becomes distant, her eyes moist and she blinks. When she speaks, it is with a soft voice.`
			`	"I knew Rhon. And he may have actually learned the symbols from me, although I did not realize this until now."`
			`	You both stare at her in disbelief.`
			`	"It was many years ago, I had just started my first job and was working in the reception area of Allhome Spaceport. There he was, one day. Obviously, he had taken the trip through the wormhole by accident. I believe, at the time he had just deserted the Pirates and was fleeing the headhunters."`
			`	"I helped him to settle in. Rhon had a genuine interest into the Hai and our philosophy of peace. He was a fascinating human. We became close friends."`
			`	She pauses for a moment and then continues. "Back then, I was studying to advance in the governmental services. He helped me with that, and that's where he must have picked up the ancient symbols. He was a quick learner."`
			choice
				`	"What happened next?"`
			`"He stood out, so many humans noticed him. I assume one of them told the Pirates, because one day a fleet of them apeared in Hai space. I was working at the time, so I knew as soon as they had exited the worm hole. Rhon had always warned me that something like that might happen."`
			`	"We were prepared, so we retreated deeper into Hai space. Rhon had hoped that he could shake them that way, but they kept searching and caused all sorts of troubles. So Rhon decided to leave Hai space to restore peace."`
			`	"He offered me to take me with him, but back then I was not ready to leave my people, so I declined." The regret in her voice is tangible.`
			`	"After that, I never saw him again. But I never forgot him. The time with him inspired me to learn more about the humans and to eventually become the envoy for the human government."`
			`	She returns into the present. "I am glad to hear that he lived a good life and achieved redemption amongst humans."`
			choice
				`	"So, will you translate the symbols?"`
			`Sayari makes the chittering sound you know equals the Hai version of laughter. "I already have. 'Enter the system with the Iron Sky, where you would pick up goods for the highest possible profit, and utter the name of my Hai friend'. So, do you know what to do?"`

			`	Sayari blinks at you: "This is the system that we retreated to. I would like to accompony you on this quest. Somehow, I am already involved, anyway. Officially, I will go to Hai-home to report on the new developments."`
			`	Rek, who can barely contain her excitement, chimes in: "Yes, and I will also come along. I just need to inform my Korath contacts that I will be away for a while."`

			`While on the landing approach, you notice that this time the facilities are much smaller. You barely fit your ship into the landing zone.`
			`	The facilities as such consist of the landing bay and an additional room separated by a close gate. When you approach the gate, each member of the party is scanned.`

			`	At this moment, the holographic projector activates and an elderly Rhon stands in front of you. He also speaks in Hai.`
			`	"Welcome again, and I [appreciate, value] that you have brought Sayari with you. I can also see that each of you is from a different [species, origin]. This will help you at a later [time, moment]. But to get there, you will have to [follow the path, take the journey] that I took."`
			`	Beside the hologram, symbols appear. You have no difficulty recognizing them, they are Remnant hand signals, but you do not understand all of them.`
			`	"You may want to [record, memorize] them."`
			`	You do as the voice recommends and capture the signs. Once you are done, they vanish. The hologram bids you farewell: "Enjoy and [learn, grow] while you follow in my [footsteps, legacy]."`
			`	With that, you are alone.`
			`	Rek issues a serious of clicks which, as you have learned, indicates his amusement. "You have already solved the 2nd clue - admit it."`
			choice
				`	"Well, yes and no. I know what these symbols are - they are signs from the Remants, a group of humans who fled the Alpha Wars into isolation and who now communicate through sign language and not by spoken word."`
			`Rek is excited. "That is fascinating. Albeit..." He looks down at his lengthy, claw-like fingers. Sayari looks at her small paws. They both look at you. "I believe, you will have to do the 'talking'". You all break out into laughter.`
			`	You try to dampen the mood a bit. "We will require help in any case. My 'Remnant' is not sufficient. I recognize some of the symbols, but not enough. Unfortunately, the Remnant are pretty much at the other end of the galaxy."`

# Der Weg nach The Hideout: schafft es, Jump-Drive in Starling eingebaut, Reise durch Korath-Space bis zur Quark-Ringwelt
# Rhon hat die Quark-Technik von den Quarks bekommen / behalten dürfen, weil er eine Prirate-Gang zur Strecke gebracht hat, die Quark-Technologie gezielt gestohlen hat
# Nächste Clues sind entlang der Route zu den Wanderern
# Dann muss Rek sein Geheimnis enthüllen - er oder jemand der ihm nahe stand, haben Rhon die Pläne für die Hurricane verraten

# Vielleicht der irre gewordene Verräter als Gegner und nicht Belzebub? Oder vielleicht ist er Belzebub? Nee, zu weit hergeholt
# Aber Belzebub hätte insofern noch ein Bonus, weil Paris auch mit von der Partie ist und beide noch eine Rechnung zu begleichen haben => Paris geht auf Suicide-Mission und setzt Belzebub ausser Gefecht, kehrt 
#     zurück und gesteht Raven seine Liebe. <schluchz>

# Charaktere an Bord: - mal aufschreiben, welche Partei was interessiert
# Sayari
# Rek
# Yohna
# Freya
# Raven
# Paris
# Bruder / Schwester nicht vergessen?

#Plot-Twists:
# Freya und Taely freunden sich an und werden künftig zusammen arbeiten und sich regelmässig besuchen -> Besuch auf Deneb
# Ermuntere Paris, Raven eine Chance zu geben - Romanze zwischen Paris und Raven
# Raven und Paris gehen gemeinsam auf Urlaub??? Oder auf Mission
# Sayari geht zu Danford? Vielleicht am Ende?
# Danfort könnte mit Sayari und Rek zu den Wanderern aufbrechen, um offiziell Beziehungen aufzunehmen und erste, friedliche Kontakte mit den Korath aufzunehmen?

# Idee mit Lösungen - Umsetzung via Schiff, dass nur beschränkte Reichweite hat und nur über den richtigen Weg zum Ziel kommt, sonst liegen bleibt ????
# Finaler Kampf gegen Belzebub - mehrere Timer, ausweichen ist die einzige Chance
# Zwischendurch Einblendungen
# Paris geht auf Selbstmordmission, Raven zeigt Gefühle
# Dann geht Wurmloch auf, wo Belzebub nicht folgen kann
# Dort gibt‘s dann das Schiff - zurück, Belzebub-Schiff vernichten, dann Paris einsammeln

# Schiffe, die er hat: 
# Hurricane, Kestrel (hat die Pläne von dem einem Mitbekommen)
