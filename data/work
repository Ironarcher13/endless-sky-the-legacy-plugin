			`When you arrive at Sayari's place, she is not alone - Rek is with her.`
			`	"<first>, how good to see you again. I was just at the council to report on my progress, when I met Sayari. She mentioned you were also here, so I insisted to join her."`
			`	You notice that Rek's english has again improved. Sayari has somehow arranged for some suitable food for each of you to be delivered. During the meal, you wonder if Rek's presence does further or hinder your course. In any case, it is a wonderful evening with good food and conversations.`
			`	In the end, you decide that Rek's language capabilities may actually be helpful.`
			choice
				`	Disclose your story to both of them.`
			`When it seems to be the appropriate time, you start telling your friends about Rhon's legacy and how you stumbled into this adventure by pure coincidence.`
			`	While Rek is excited by the idea of a treasure hunt and a new adventure, Sayari becomes very quiet. When you show the symbols to Sayari, her look becomes distant, her eyes moist and she blinks. When she speaks, it is with a soft voice.`
			`	"I knew Rhon. And he may have actually learned the symbols from me, although I did not realize this until now."`
			`	You both stare at her in disbelief.`
			`	"It was many years ago, I had just started my first job and was working in the reception area of Allhome Spaceport. There he was, one day. Obviously, he had taken the trip through the wormhole by accident. I believe, at the time he had just deserted the Pirates and was fleeing the headhunters."`
			`	"I helped him to settle in. Rhon had a genuine interest into the Hai and their philosophy of peace. He was a fascinating man. We became ...close."`
			`	She pauses for a moment and then continues. "Back then, I was studying to advance in the governmental services. He helped me with that, and that's where he must have picked up the ancient symbols. He was a quick learner."`
			choice
				`	"What happened next?"`
			`"He was a special man, and many humans noticed that. I assume that one of them must have told the Pirates, because one day a fleet of them apeared in Hai space. I was working at the time, so I knew as soon as they had exited the worm hole. Rhon had always warned me that something like that might happen."`
			`	"We were prepared, so we managed to flee deeper into Hai space before they could find him. Rhon had hoped that he could shake them that way, but they continued and starting causing all sorts of troubles. So Rhon decided to leave Hai space to restore peace."`
			`	"He offered me to take me with him, but back then I was not ready to leave my people, so I declined." The regret in her voice is tangible.`
			`	"After that, I never saw him again. But I never forgot him. The time with him inspired me to learn more about the humans and to become the envoy for the human government."`
			`	She returns into the present. "I am glad to hear that he lived a good life and achieved redemption amongst humans."`
			choice
				`	"So, will you translate the symbols?"`
			`Sayari makes the chittering sound you know equals the Hai version of laughter. "I already have. 'Enter the system with the Iron Sky and utter the name of my Hai savior and friend'. So, do you know what to do?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I believe I have an idea of where we need to go."`
					goto "smart_player_1c3"
				`	"Sorry, but I am clueless. Can you help?"`
			`"I am pretty sure that the Iron Sky refers to the metallic meteorites of the Imo Dep system. I assume we need to go there and then you need to broadcast my name."`
			label "smart_player_1c3"
			`	Sayari blinks at you: "This is the system that we fled to. If you do not mind, I would like to accompony you on this quest. Somehow, I am already involved, anyway."`
			`	Rek, who can barely contain her excitement, chimes in: "Yes, and I will also come along. It has been a long time since I had anything that exciting and refreshing."`
			`	Somehow, you feel that your chances of solving this mystery just have significantly improved. You are glad that your friends have joined your quest.`

			`While on the landing approach, you notice that this time the facilities are much smaller. You barely fit your ship into the landing zone.`
			`	The facilities as such consist of the landing bay and an additional room separated by a close gate. When you approach the gate, each member of the party is scanned.`
			`	When a voice speaks, you are glad you brought the translator, because it is speaking Hai. "Welcome, [seekers, explorers]. I will admit you for the next [clue, hint] in a moment. But first let Sayari enter alone."`

			label "enter_sayari"
			`Sayari steps towards the gate, which opens, let her pass and then closes after her.`
			`	After a while, the gate opens again and the voice invites you to step forward. You join Sayari in a plain room which contains not much more but a holographic projector.`
			`	Sayari seems happy and sad at the same time. "Rhon had left me a personal farewell message. I am so glad that you brought me here."`
			`	At this moment, the holographic projector activates and an elderly Rhon stands in front of you. He also speaks in Hai.`
			`	"Welcome again, and I [appreciate, value] that you have brought Sayari with you. I can also see that each of you is from a different [species, origin]. This will help you at a later [time, moment]. But to get there, you will have to [follow the path, take the journey] that I took."`
			`	Beside the hologram, symbols appear. You have no difficulty recognizing them, they are Remnant hand signals, but you do not understand all of them.`
			`	"You may want to [record, memorize] them."`
			`	You do as the voice recommended and take a capture the symbols. Once you are done, they vanish. The hologram bids you farewell: "Enjoy and [learn, grow] while you follow in my [footsteps, legacy].`
			`	With that, you are alone.`
			`	Rek issues a serious of clicks which, as you have learned, indicates his amusement. "You have already solved the 2nd clue - admit it."`
			choice
				`	"Well, yes and now. I know what these symbols are - they are signs from the Remants, a group of humans who fled the Alpha Wars into isolation and who now communicate through sign language on not by spoken word."`
			`Rek is excited. "That is fascinating. Albeit..." He looks down at his lengthy, claw-like fingers. Sayari looks at her small paws. They both look at you. "I believe, you will have to do the 'talking'". You all break out into laughter.`
			`	You try to dampen the mood a bit. "We will require help in any case. My 'Remnant' is not sufficient. I recognize some of the symbols, but not enough. Unfortunately, the Remnant are pretty much at the other end of the galaxy."`
			`	Rek is not deterred: "Well, then we better depart." Sayari chimes in: "It's good then that I had the ship loaded with provisions before departure."`

However, when you land on <planet>, only you exit the space craft, since you are unsure how the Remnant would react to the presence of aliens.`
			`	After you passed the mandatory blood test, you manage to find Taely in the shipyards and - even though your Remant is a bit rusty - manage to explain her the reason for your visit.`
			`	When you hand her a printed version of the symbols, she starts reading them and then looks up to you in surprise. She hesitates for a moment and then she signs you to meet her at the shipyard exit to the Spaceport in the evening.`

			`When you enter the shipyards, Taely is already waiting for you, and she is not alone. With her are a woman and a man, who you judge to be siblings. They are both about your age and share the same distinctive and very attractive look.`
			`	Taely, in her usual way, get's straight down to business: "Hello Captain <last>. Since you have helped us in the past, I will try my best to help you now. You will need a remnant translator to accompany you. While I can't join you myself, I have found two in my team who would be suitable to help you. I vouch for them. Please meet Yohna and Yahon.`
			`	You exchange greetings. They are both friendly but you also feel apprehension.`
			`	The reason for this becomes apparent when Taely continues: "Unfortunately, I can spare only of them, and even that only as a favour to a special friend of the Remnant. There is just too much work at the moment. So, you will have to chose."`

			`	Yohna beams at you with happyness. You notice that with a smile on her face she looks even more pretty.`
			`	"Thank you for allowing me to join you, Captain." You are taken aback, not so much by her alluring voice, but by the fact that she adressed you in regular spoken english without any song.`

I would invite you into one of the restaurants here, but I am well aware on how dull Remnant kitchen is to outsiders. Besides, that way I can get to know your companions. I am really looking forward to meeting them."`
			`	You realize she must be aware of your aliens friends. Once again, she recognizes your surprise and you hear her adorable laughter. "Taely has her eyes and ears pretty much everywhere. You don't think that any foreign ship can approach Remnant space without Taely knowing about load and crew? Oh, and she really appreciates that you left your alien friends on board of your ship. Sometimes, the officers running the blood check can be a bit... difficult."`
			`	As smitten as you are by Yohna, your wits are slowly coming back to you. "Ah, so that is why you are joining the party and not just translating - to ensure the Remnant will get a share in case anything interesting gets discovered."`
			`	Yohna looks at you for a moment. Then she reaches a decision: "Okay, let us be honest with each other. Yes and no. Ensuring that we participate from any interesting discovery may have been the decisive argument to send someone along, but Taely is really fond of you and genuinly wanted to help you."`
			`	"And for me, this is the chance I have been waiting for. I am in this as much as for Taely as for myself." She pauses and then looks you so intense in the eyes that you stomach starts to tingle. "Captain, I pledge myself to your quest and will be true to it."`

			`	"Okay, you are a great teacher, but maybe it's about time you show us that you are also good at solving riddles." With that you bring up the symbols on the main screen.`
			`	Yohna takes a look and then turns to you in surprise. "No wonder you have difficulties reading these - they are in a rare dialect."`
			`	On your question "But you can read them?", she responds: "Yes, I actually grew up with them. They direct to a location and give instructions on what to do. But they are written in riddles."`

			`	You offer her the co-pilot seat and she gracefully settles beside you. For a moment, she watches the stars outside.`
			`	It is then that you realize what makes her stand out amongst other Remnant. It is the colour of her eyes. Where most of the Remnant have dark eyes, her are a warm amber, almost golden.`
			`	She speaks softly: "I have seen this view a hundred times and still love it like the first time. Some may call it the Ember Waste, but for me it is more home than Aventine."`
			`	"How so?"`
			`	"I pretty much grew up in this area. My mother worked for the Remnant military and was part of the unit which would maintain our scout network and patrol the Waste systems. Most of her comrades preferred short turns, but she only returned to HQ when she had to."`
			`	You wonder: "That must have been tough for you as a child".`
			`	"Not really. We were never really alone. I had my brother, but there were also several like my mother who preferred to keep to themselves and who had kids. We called us the 'Waste-Folks'. We were a committed community and could absolutely rely on each other. The symbols from the clue are in 'Waste-Folks' dialect. So this Rhon must have been part of the community, at least for a while. It is strange I never heard of him."`

She wanted us to also know the regular Remnant life. She and Taely go way back, mother often brought her interesting things, so Taely took us under her wings."`

			`	"I... I don't know who he is. Mother would never speak of him. Yahon once overheard an argument between her and Taely, where mother blamed the government for him not being with us. That's pretty much all I know, because neither Taely nor any of the Waste-Folks would tell us more."`
